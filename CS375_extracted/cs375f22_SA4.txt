Analysis of AlgorithmsCS  Fall Smaller Assignment DueBY THE BEGINNING OF CLASS Monday November For this Smaller Assignment as long as you submit answers on time before thedeadline with a demonstrable strong effort to solve the problems and thoroughexplanations of your answersincluding if you were not able to solve an exercisewhat progress you made what was left unsolved and what made it hard to solveifyou do not receive full credit you will be able to revise your answer after receivingfeedback to bring your grade up to full creditFor this Smaller Assignment the standard file naming conventions apply Please submit your typewritten answers in a PDF file namedCS SAuseridpdfwhere userid is replaced by your Colby userid your full userid including class yearand submit it to your SubmittedWork folder in your Google drive space for this courseA general note for CS As always please present answers cleanly and explainthem clearly and thoroughly  giving all details needed to make your answers easyto understand typedup rather than handwritten answers are especially appreciatedGraders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions Clear communication isthe point on every assignmentIn general in CS unless explicitly specified otherwise answers without explanationsmay not receive full credit Please feel free to ask me any questions about explanationsthat might come upExercises Using the unwinding method from class solve the following recurrence relation andgive the  class of the solutionTn  Tn for n T  Show your work in doing the unwinding To show a full understanding of the unwinding method please be sure to show a kth stepa step at some representative kthstep in the unwinding in terms of krather than some specific number as demonstratedin the lecture of November  and shown in lecture noteswhich shows the patternupon which your solution is based Solve the following recurrence showing your work using the recursion treemethod and give the  class of the solutionTn  Tn for n T  Please show your work by including a table of the following form The table shouldinclude one row for each level in the tree be sure to show a representative kth levelto illustrate the relevant pattern similar to the kth step in the unwinding methodlevel number of nodes on level total work number of nodes on level  total work on level  number of nodes on level  total work on level  number of nodes on level  total work on level   k number of nodes on level k total work on level k  last level number of nodes on last level total work on last level Then explain how you use information from your table to arrive at a final answerRecall that you can use highlevel explanations for  analysis you dont need to givewitnesses for the values of the relevant constantsNOTES You might want to explicitly include the secondtolast level in your table aswell as the last level because the last level is sometimes so different from the remainderof the table that it does not fit into the pattern Also you are also welcome to includea picture of the recursion tree as part of your answer if youd like but it is not requiredfor the exercise Give a  bound for the following recurrence Be sure to use the Master Theorem forthis exercise As always be sure to give a brief explanation of your answerhere thatwill include the values for each relevant variable in the Master Theorem what case ofthe Theorem you are applying and a brief explanation of how you know what case toapply A full explanation could take no more than  sentencesTn  Tn nT   Give a  bound for the following recurrence using any of the three methods introducedin class unwinding recursion tree Master methodTn  Tn nlgnT  As always be sure to give a brief explanation with appropriate details of your answer
