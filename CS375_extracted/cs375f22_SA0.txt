analysis of algorithms  cs  fall  small assignment   due by the beginning of class wednesday september    for this smaller assignment the standard file naming conventions apply please sub-  mit your typewritten answers in a pdf file named  cs sa userid pdf  where userid is replaced by your colby userid for example my file would be called cs sa eaaron pdf   additional submission instructions will be emailed to you soon including where to submit your pdf file    as usual in cs if an exercise is given by number e g  exercise    pg    that refers to our clrs textbook unless stated otherwise    from your textbook clrs please read   appendices a  and b     chapter  and      a general note for cs as always please present answers cleanly and explain them thoroughly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understand  graders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions or answers without explanations  clear communication is the point on every assignment   please feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come up  exercises    set exercises familiarity with sets and set operations is important for computer science in general and for algorithm design and complexity analysis in particular so here are some warm-up exercises  give a short explanation for every answer less than one sentence could suffice as long as it demonstrates understanding of the relevant def- initions  reasons for the answer   for the exercises below let a  x y z and b  x y  a true or false a  b b true or false b  a c true or false b  b d what is a  b explicitly show the elements of a  b  e what is a  b explicitly show the elements of a  b  f what is a  b explicitly show the elements of a  b  g what is pb the power set of b explicitly show the elements of pb       exercise    pg    we need only consider natural number values of n and we  can make the usual assumption that all input sizes are greater than      as happens sometimes in theoretical cs exercises this one begins with a completely gratuitous and totally made-up backstory the scientific advancement department at the portland institute of technology which to be clear does not actually exist has asked for your help  the entire department will soon be traveling they'll be going to major european cities with well-developed subway systems such as london england or paris france and they've asked you to come up with an algorithm to find the best route for a subway passenger to take from one subway station to another   a the statement of this computational problem isn't fully unambiguously specified which happens frequently with real-world computational problems  i've experi- enced it myself several times in my research  but you can help what are some reasonable criteria that could be used for defining the best route give  examples   b how would you use a graph as part of modeling and solving this problem feel  free to look over appendix b  for a review of graph concepts if you'd like
