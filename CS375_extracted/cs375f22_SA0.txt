 analysis of algorithms cs  fall  small assignment  dueby the beginning of class wednesday september  for this smaller assignment the standard file naming conventions apply please sub- mit your typewritten answers in a pdf file named cs sauserid pdf where userid is replaced by your colby userid for example my file would be called cs saeaaron pdf   additional submission instructions will be emailed to you soon including where to submit your pdf file  as usual in cs if an exercise is given by number e g  exercise    pg   that refers to our clrs textbook unless stated otherwise  from your textbook clrs please read appendices a  and b   chapter  and    a general note for cs as always please present answers cleanly and explain them thoroughly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understand  graders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions or answers without explanations  clear communication isthe point on every assignment  please feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come up exercises  set exercises familiarity with sets and set operations is important for computer science in general and for algorithm design and complexity analysis in particular so here are some warm-up exercises  give a short explanation for every answer less than one sentence could suffice as long as it demonstrates understanding of the relevant def- initions  reasons for the answer  for the exercises below let ax y zandbx y  a true or false ab b true or false ba c true or false bb d what is ab explicitly show the elements of ab  e what is ab explicitly show the elements of ab  f what is ab explicitly show the elements of ab  g what is pb the power set of b explicitly show the elements of pb     exercise    pg    we need only consider natural number values of n and we can make the usual assumption that all input sizes are greater than     as happens sometimes in theoretical cs exercises this one begins with a completely gratuitous andtotally made-up backstory the scientific advancement department at the portland institute of technology which to be clear does not actually exist has asked for your help  the entire department will soon be traveling they'll be going to major european cities with well-developed subway systems such as london england or paris france and they've asked you to come up with an algorithm to find the best route for a subway passenger to take from one subway station to another  a the statement of this computational problem isn't fully unambiguously specified which happens frequently with real-world computational problems  i've experi- enced it myself several times in my research  but you can help what are some reasonable criteria that could be used for defining the best route give  examples  b how would you use a graph as part of modeling and solving this problem feel free to look over appendix b  for a review of graph concepts if you'd like
