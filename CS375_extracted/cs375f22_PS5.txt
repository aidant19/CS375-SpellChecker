analysis of algorithms  cs  fall   problem set   due by pm on friday december    for this assignment standard file naming conventions apply please submit your type- written answers in a pdf file named cs ps userid pdf where userid is re- placed by your full colby userid and submit it to your submittedwork folder  please reach out to me right away with any questions or concerns about this   a general note for cs when writing up your homework please present your answers neatly and explain your answers clearly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understand  graders may not award full credit to incomplete or hard to understand solutions  clear communication is the point on every assignment   in general in cs unless explicitly specified otherwise answers should be accompa- nied by explanations  answers without explanations may not receive full credit  please feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come up   important reminder as stated on our syllabus  first-day handout all work for cs problem sets and smaller assignments must be submitted by the end of the last day of classes that's pm on friday december   even late work must be turned in by then to have the grade dropped when final grades are calculated  please turn in this ps and all other work other than our last project by that deadline  as always extenuating circumstances will be considered  please talk with me as soon as possible if there are extenuating circumstances or you believe you cannot meet that deadline  exercises    a rook-y move  in chess a rook can move horizontally or vertically to any square in the same row or in the same column of a chessboard  find the number of shortest paths by which a rook can move from the bottom-left corner of a chessboard to the top-right corner  the length of a path is measured by the number of squares it passes through including the first and the last squares   solve the problem by a dynamic programming method  that is come up with a relevant recurrence i e  a recursive definition of the relevant values for a solution as we've seen in the examples from class and using dynamic programming techniques calculate the solution  please show your work by giving an    table each element in the table represents the corresponding square on the chessboard where each entry in the table should be the number of paths from the bottom-left corner to that square on the chessboard therefore the answer to this exercise will be the number in the top-right element of your table   note that you do not need to provide a shortest path from one corner to the other just the number of shortest such paths  please be sure to include an explanation of the correctness of your recurrences a well-worded paragraph could suffice you do not need to explain how you used the generated the table from the recurrence       bridge crossing revisited consider the generalization of the bridge crossing ex- ercise earlier in the semester ps exercise  in which there are n   people whose bridge crossing times are t t       tn  all the other conditions of the problem are the same as before at most two people at a time can cross the bridge and they move with the speed of the slower of the two and they must carry with them the only flashlight the group has   a design a greedy method for getting the entire group across the bridge with the goal of minimizing the total time for the group to cross  give a very brief expla- nation of what makes it a greedy method   b show that the greedy method does not always yield an optimal solution i e  a minimal crossing time for every instance of this problem by giving a concrete counterexample with the smallest number of people for which it is not opti- mal
