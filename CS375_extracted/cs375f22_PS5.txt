Analysis of AlgorithmsCS  Fall Problem Set Dueby pm onFriday December For this assignment standard file naming conventions apply Please submit your typewritten answers in a PDF file named CS PSuseridpdf where userid is replaced by your full Colby userid and submit it to your SubmittedWork folder Pleasereach out to me right away with any questions or concerns about thisA general note for CS When writing up your homework please present youranswers neatly and explain your answers clearly  giving all details needed to makeyour answers easy to understand Graders may not award full credit to incomplete orhard to understand solutions Clear communication isthe point on every assignmentIn general in CS unless explicitly specified otherwise answers should be accompanied by explanations Answers without explanations may not receive full credit Pleasefeel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come upImportant Reminder As stated on our syllabus  firstday handout all work forCS Problem Sets and Smaller Assignments must be submitted by the end of the lastday of classesthats pm on Friday December   Even late work must beturned in by then to have the grade dropped when final grades are calculated Pleaseturn in this PS and all other work other than our last Project by that deadlineAs always extenuating circumstances will be considered Please talk with me as soonas possible if there are extenuating circumstances or you believe you cannot meet thatdeadlineExercisesA Rooky Move In chess a rook can move horizontally or vertically to any squarein the same row or in the same column of a chessboard Find the number of shortestpaths by which a rook can move from the bottomleft corner of a chessboard to thetopright corner  The length of a path is measured by the number of squares it passesthrough including the first and the last squaresSolve the problem by a dynamic programming method That is come up with arelevant recurrenceie a recursive definition of the relevant values for a solution asweve seen in the examples from classand using dynamic programming techniquescalculate the solution Please show your work by giving an   table each elementin the table represents the corresponding square on the chessboard where each entryin the table should be the number of paths from the bottomleft corner to that squareon the chessboard therefore the answer to this exercise will be the number in thetopright element of your tableNote that you do not need to provide a shortest path from one corner to the otherjust the number of shortest such paths Please be sure to include an explanation ofthe correctness of your recurrences a wellworded paragraph could suffice you do notneed to explain how you used the generated the table from the recurrenceBridge Crossing Revisited Consider the generalization of the bridge crossing exercise earlier in the semester PS exercise  in which there are n  people whosebridge crossing times are t t    t n All the other conditions of the problem are thesame as before at most two people at a time can cross the bridge and they move withthe speed of the slower of the two and they must carry with them the only flashlightthe group hasa Design a greedy method for getting the entire group across the bridge with thegoal of minimizing the total time for the group to cross Give a very brief explanation of what makes it a greedy methodb Show that the greedy method does not always yield an optimal solution ie aminimal crossing time for every instance of this problem by giving a concretecounterexample with the smallest number of people for which it is not optimal
