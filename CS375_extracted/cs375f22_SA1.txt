Analysis of AlgorithmsCS  Fall Small Assignment DueBY THE BEGINNING OF CLASS Monday September For this Smaller Assignment the standard file naming conventions apply Please submit your typewritten answers in a PDF file namedCS SAuseridpdfwhere userid is replaced by your Colby userid your full userid including classyearfor example my file would be called CS SAeaaronpdf and submit it toyour SubmittedWork folder in your Google drive space for this course Please reachout to me right away with any questions or concerns about thisA general note for CS As always please present answers cleanly and explainthem thoroughly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understandGraders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions or answerswithout explanations Clear communication isthe point on every assignmentPlease feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come upExercises Familiarity with summations andPnotation is essential for algorithm complexityanalysis Here are some warmup exercises For these exercises as usual for CSplease be sure to show your work and give a short but informative explanation forevery answera Exercise A pg  A simple formula here means a mathematicalexpression with noPnotation for which plugging in a value for nwill give thenumeric value of the formula For example a simple formula forPniiisnnb Find a simple formula forPniiHintsPlease reread CLRS Appendix AOften a good way to solve these exercises is to use properties of summations suchasLinearity  on pg  to transform your summation into another form andthen apply some known summation formulas to get the  notation out Thesummation formulas A page  and A page  are my favoritesSometimes with summations it can be easy to make offbyone errors Thismay or may not apply to your solutions to these exercises depending on yourapproach but in general please be on the lookout for offbyone errors Here are a few exercises on properties of logarithms Youll be asked to show thata few properties of logarithms are true The objective is to help you become morefamiliar with some properties of logarithms that are especially important for analysisof recursive algorithmsAs an example heres how we might show that logbxy logbx logby In the belowrecall from the definition of logarithm that a logarithm really stands for an exponentxlogbnmeans that bxn ie xis the exponent we raise bto to get nTo make it easier to talk about raising some relevant expressions to a powerwell introduce a few variables let k logbxy logbx and m logbyThen by the definition of logarithm above bkxybx and bmyNote Do you see why Therefore bkbbmbm and thus by standardproperties of exponents km which is what we had set out to showNow pick  of the following  properties of logarithms your choice and show thatthey are true If you turn in all  of them only your best  will be counted for yourgrade so I hope youll give all  of them a tryPlease give detailed explanations as shown in the example above Assume that a b c nare positive real numbers but notethey are not necessarily integersa logbannlogbab logbnlogcnlogcb This shows that changing the base of a logarithmsay fromlogbntologcnreally means multiplying by a constant factor because this couldbe rewritten as logbnlogcblogcncalogbnnlogba This result is sometimes called the logswitching theorem sinceit says that we can switch aandn
