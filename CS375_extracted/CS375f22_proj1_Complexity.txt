 analysis of algorithms cs  fall  project  dueby pm on wednesday september  project  determining algorithmic time complexity in this assignment you'll work in teams of  or  to determine the asymptotic time complex- ities of methods in two java classes  in part  you will be given source code for the class and you will figure out asymptotic complexities by analyzing that code  in part  you will notbe given the source code for the class you will instead conjecture about time complex- ity by using definitions of asymptotic complexity and analyzing the number of comparisons the methods make during execution  the goals of this project are to give you practice determining the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm given its source code to give you practice using the scientific method and the formal definitions of asymptotic complexity to guess at the worst-case time complexity of algorithms for which you don't have the source code and to give you practice working with other students in a team  exercises   for part   download the source code for the arrayintegerset class from the course projects and presentations website  for each constructor and method in the arrayintegerset class determine its worst- case time complexity using  notation in terms of the number of elements nin the set and if appropriate any other data such as the size mof any parameters  for each method please add something like the following in its comment header  time complexity n where nis the size of this arrayintegerset for every method be sure to unambiguously state what each variable in your time complexity expression refers to  for example if two relevant variables refer to arrays be very clear which variable refers to which array  for example please be more specific than saying the input array as from some perspective any relevant parameter could be viewed as input along with each asymptotic complexity bound include a short  sentences at most explanation of how you came up with your complexity bound  if your answer depends upon the complexity of other methods in the class note that as well  be sure to give the complexity of all methods except for main  whether public or private     for part   download the sortdata csv file from the course projects and presentations website  this file contains the data obtained by running  sorting algorithms and counting how many comparisons they make during execution  the sorting algorithms themselves will not be made available to you  the data in the file was gathered as follows for each desired array size a random array aof that size was created then each of the sorting algorithms was run on array a  to be clear all algorithms were run on the same array a  based on this data make a useful conjecture on the worst-case asymptotic time com- plexity of each of the  algorithms to show a practical understanding of each algo- rithm's performance  then write a report containing these conjectures and explana- tions supporting them  for each be sure to explicitly employ the relevant formal definitions of asymptotic complexity used in your conjectures and include the mathematical details about how you apply them to the data  for example if using big-o notation give the particular values of threshold input size nand leading con- stant cused to support your conjecture and show how they are applied to the data to lead to your conclusion if using  notation give the nvalue and both leading constants candc and similarly show how they are applied  full credit may not be given for conjectures that are not consistent with the known asymptotic time complex- ity performance of these sorting algorithms so please be careful and detailed in your analysis please be sure that your explanations discuss your reasons for supporting your conjec- tures or being skeptical of them if that's relevant because the formal definitions of asymptotic complexity are essential for analyzing your conjectures please include all details necessary to show command of the relevant asymptotic complexity definitions and how they are employed  for example simply employing a statistical curve-fitting method would not be sufficient for these exercises additional interrogation of the data directly relating to definitions of asymptotic complexity is required  please keep the following notes in mind please treat this part of the project like a physics or chemistry project in which you are creating a report making conjectures based on the results of an experiment  therefore a significant part of evaluating your work will be the consideration of whether or not the data are sufficiently analyzed or if the conclusions are logical  in other words don't just say here's our conjecture        please also include your analysis of the data such as describing how you came up with your conjecture instead of a different conjecture  as usual in cs assignments clear communication isthe point there will be deductions if it is difficult for your grader to understand your process and conclu- sion  please treat your written report as being as important as your conclusions  also as usual for cs assignments please feel free to talk with me if you have questions especially if you are unsure what to include in your report  what to submit each group should submit just one set of answers  in particular each team should submit two files for part  turn in a text file that includes only the source code that you analyzed and the time complexity information about all the methods as described in exercise  above  the time complexity information should be included in the comment header for each function  to indicate the team submitting that file please be sure to name your file teaminitialsarrayintegerset java where initials is replaced by the initials of the team members in the group in the team assignments  e g  if eric aaron and stephanie taylor were the teammates the file from that team would be called team eastarrayintegerset java   for part  turn in a project report pdf file that has your report but in the filename as above please add the prefix indicating your team members' initials e g  team eastproject report pdf lateness policy to keep pace with the project assignments in cs it is important that this assignment be turned in promptly  for this project there will be a deduction of   for each day late i e    deduction for submitting up to  hours late   deduction for submitting more than  hours late up to  hours etc up to a  deduction for submitting up to  days  hours late  after  days late submissions will receive a one-third    deduction  please submit your work promptly as always extenuating circumstances will be considered please contact me as soon as possible if any extenuating circumstances are impeding your work on this project submission instructions  for this project each group should have one designated sub- mitter to handle submission of their materials  the designated submitter should email me eaaroncolby edu the two files
