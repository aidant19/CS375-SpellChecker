graph representations are very useful and broadly  applicable   examples robot navigation  inspection problems  patrol  team of robots repeatedly inspects all critical p oints on a map e g   locations of valuable items to check for intruder s or other problems  boundary coverage  team of robots completely inspects the boundaries  of all  items in a d-mapped environment  pursuit-evasion  team of robots corners  captures intruders that are trying to  avoid capture  map visitation  team of robots visits every critical point on a m ap   typically a map underlies these problems  solutions and that map  is represented by a graph  map visitation problem mvp   there are multiple variations on the mvp but we'l l look at the multi- robot  multi-depot mvp   optimization problem fastest way for a team of ro bots starting from a  collection of depot locations on a map to visit al l nodes on that map   mvp looks at this as how do we make sure that the  last node visited is  visited as soon as possible to get information about  every node as soon  as possible note this isn't the same as say minimizing total distance traveled  by all robots combined it's a different metric for o ptimization  properties of map  robots for mvp    each robot starts at a specified depot    navigation on the map is pre-computed not figure d  out by the robot as it moves    a solution to mvp means at least one robot visits   each point on the map       robots  start here example  cs --    map visitation problem mvp   so you're at your job and your supervisor tells you to write an  efficient poly-time algo to solve the mvp in the general ca se not  just special cases of it  what do you do  input integer knumber of robots  weighted undirected graph g  ve map for visitation    depots dv   vkstarting

ideas  map visitation problem mvp   so you're at your job and your supervisor tells you to write an  efficient poly-time algo to solve the mvp in the general ca se not  just special cases of it  what do you do multiple choice    use a minimum-spanning tree approach    use an all-pairs shortest paths approach    have a long conversation with your supervisor abo ut wasting your time  input integer

coming up on cs what's the fastest sorting algorithm   is it quicksort   the answer might surprise you or it might not  all the hottest fashion trends for programmers most important  complexity classes for programmers   with essential algos from each one  common myths about recursion debunked   some of the answers here actually might surprise you  how to make an algorithm not just a little faster but a lot faster  could your next problem be np-complete  and how would you know  plus language  nlp applications  a little peek into what a compiler   interpreter does and more have you heard of np-completeness  before what do you know about it  cs --    review subroutines   an algorithm that solves a problem can be used as a subroutine  in another algorithm   key to using subroutines understanding the specif ications of the  problems being solved   example subroutine solving merge problem   input arrays a  x     xm and a  y   yn of numbers in sorted  order   output array n  n   nmn  of numbers in sorted order combining  all of x     xmand y   yninto n   how could we use a merge subroutine to create a sorting  algorithm problem specs given as  input  output descriptions  review subroutines and reductions   in general and in these specific examples key to using a  subroutine is to meet its specifications   structure your algorithm to give subroutine the pr oper input   structure your algorithm to use subroutine's outpu t to solve the original  problem   in these cases can reduce one problem a to another problem  b where there's already a subroutine  algorithm for b   algorithm that does the reducing can be called a  reduction  example   mergesort reduced to merge  cs --    subroutines and time complexity   in general and in these specific examples key to using a  subroutine is to meet its specifications   structure your algorithm to give subroutine the pr oper input   structure your algorithm to use subroutine's outpu t to solve the original  problem   in these cases can reduce one problem a to another problem  b where there's already a subroutine  algorithm for b   algorithm that does the reducing can be called a  reduction  important but maybe obvious note   complexity of resulting algorithm depends on compl exity of subroutine  this is not surprising the complexity of every algor ithm depends  on the complexity of its parts  i'm just making tha t point explicit here  because we'll use it again later  this slide starts getting into non-review material
