analysis of algorithms  cs  fall  smaller assignment   due by the beginning of class monday november    for this smaller assignment as long as you submit answers on time before the deadline with a demonstrable strong effort to solve the problems and thorough explanations of your answers including if you were not able to solve an exercise what progress you made what was left unsolved and what made it hard to solve if you do not receive full credit you will be able to revise your answer after receiving feedback to bring your grade up to full credit   for this smaller assignment the standard file naming conventions apply please sub-  mit your typewritten answers in a pdf file named  cs sa userid pdf  where userid is replaced by your colby userid your full userid including class year and submit it to your submittedwork folder in your google drive space for this course    a general note for cs as always please present answers cleanly and explain them clearly and thoroughly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understand typed-up rather than handwritten answers are especially appreciated  graders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions  clear commu- nication is the point on every assignment   in general in cs unless explicitly specified otherwise answers without explanations may not receive full credit  please feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come up  exercises    using the unwinding method from class solve the following recurrence relation and  give the  class of the solution   t n  t n   for n   t      show your work in doing the unwinding  to show a full understanding of the un- winding method please be sure to show a k'th step a step at some representative k'th step in the unwinding in terms of k rather than some specific number as demonstrated in the lecture of november  and shown in lecture notes which shows the pattern upon which your solution is based     solve the following recurrence showing your work using the recursion tree  method and give the  class of the solution  t n  t n   for n   t      please show your work by including a table of the following form  the table should include one row for each level in the tree be sure to show a representative k'th level to illustrate the relevant pattern similar to the k'th step in the unwinding method     level  number of nodes on level  total work  number of nodes on level  number of nodes on level  number of nodes on level   total work on level  total work on level  total work on level       k   number of nodes on level k  total work on level k  last level number of nodes on last level  total work on last level        then explain how you use information from your table to arrive at a final answer  recall that you can use high-level explanations for  analysis you don't need to give witnesses for the values of the relevant constants   notes you might want to explicitly include the second-to-last level in your table as well as the last level because the last level is sometimes so different from the remainder of the table that it does not fit into the pattern  also you are also welcome to include a picture of the recursion tree as part of your answer if you'd like but it is not required for the exercise     give a  bound for the following recurrence  be sure to use the master theorem for this exercise  as always be sure to give a brief explanation of your answer here that will include the values for each relevant variable in the master theorem what case of the theorem you are applying and a brief explanation of how you know what case to apply  a full explanation could take no more than  sentences   t n  t n  n t        give a  bound for the following recurrence using any of the three methods introduced  in class unwinding recursion tree master method   t n  t n  n lg n t     as always be sure to give a brief explanation with appropriate details of your answer
