Exponential Time and The Power Set of a Set S  When we think of exponential timeor more generally something of size  length nwe often think of all subsets of a set of size nConsider set S of size n How many subsets of S are  there As a small example consider S     n   What are all the subsets          there are  of them The set of all subsets of S is called the power set of S Recall the n entry in our table of common complex ity classes CS   Exhaustive Search Brute Force  How many subsets are there of a given set S  Say for notation Shas nelements The power set of Shas  nelements What does this tell us about the asymptotic complex ity of an exhaustive search algorithm over all subsets of a set Remember exhaustive search implies that it looks at all elements at least in worst case of a collecti on Will we describe complexity using BigO  or Vocab  The set of all subsets of S is called the power set of S Exhaustive Search Brute Force  How many subsets are there of a given set S  Say for notation Shas nelements  How many orderings or permutations  are there of all elements in a list L  a   a n The power set of Shas  nelements What does this tell us about the asymptotic complex ity of an exhaustive search algorithm over all subsets of a set Vocab  The set of all subsets of S is called the power set of S CS   All Permutations of a List L Consider list L  a a a a n of length n How many permutations are there of Lie ways to put all the elements into s ome list in any order As a small example consider L     n   What are all the permutations   th ere are  of them How many would there be for list L  Hint its not just  more Factorial Time and All Permutations of a List L  When we think of factorial timeor more generally something of size  length n we often think of all permutations of a list of length nConsider list L  a a a a n of length n How many permutations are there of Lie ways to put all the elements into s ome list in any order As a small example consider L     n   What are all the permutations   th ere are  of them How many would there be for list L  Answer There are   times more Do you see why Think of how many way s a  could be inserted into list   there are  possible pl aces Recall the n entry in our table of common complexi ty classes CS   Exhaustive Search Brute Force  How many subsets are there of a given set S  Say for notation Shas nelements  How many orderings or permutations  are there of all elements in a list L  a   a n The power set of Shas  nelements What does this tell us about the asymptotic complex ity of an exhaustive search algorithm over all subsets of a set A list of length nhas n permutations What does this tell us about the asymptotic complex ity of an exhaustive search algorithm over all orderings o f elements in a list Will we describe complexity using BigO  or Vocab  The set of all subsets of S is called the power set of S Exhaustive Search Brute Force  How many subsets are there of a given set S  Say for notation Shas nelements  How many orderings or permutations  are there of all elements in a list L  a   a n The power set of Shas  nelements A list of length nhas n permutations Vocab  The set of all subsets of S is called the power set of S A takehome message For large n When things can be ordered  a list  theres a LOT more possibilities than when things c ant be ordered  a set  So exhaustive search over all subsets is faster th an over all permutations But both are really slow CS   The CS Guitar Genius Tour  Guitarists Steve Vai and Pasquale Grassoboth faves of your CS Profare finally going on tour together  There are n possible venues they could play on their tour  They could play any number of them from  to n They have a list ordering of the nvenues in mindthe order in which it makes sense to travel to them  So if the ordering is V V   Vnfrom first to last they would never play Vybefore Vxif y  x  Larger numbers are always later in the ordering  But they could skip or play any or all venues Now that weve looked at those bruteforce measures  lets answer the question here How many possible itineraries are there We want to figure out the best tour itinerary for them For now well use a brute force method of checking all possible tour itineraries How many possible itineraries are there Disclaimer They arent really touring together  The CS Guitar Genius Tour
