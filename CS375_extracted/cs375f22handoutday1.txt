welcome to cs    analysis of algorithms colby college fall '  course cs    analysis of algorithms lecture m  w  pm meetings in davis  website httpscs colby educoursesfcs  course description  analysis of algorithms focuses on classic algorithms in computer science their design and the analysis of their correctness and efficiency  algorithms covered include sorting searching and other problem solving with various data structures including strings arrays lists trees and graphs  major categories of algorithm design are discussed including the iterative divide-and- conquer exhaustive search dynamic programming and greedy paradigms  intractable problems are also discussed as is the role of np-completeness   prerequisites cs and a -level math or statistics course   your professor eric

is in partnership with the center for teaching and learning's teaching and learning  colby talc  fellowship  as part of this program our class includes a learning assistant a trained student partner who works with faculty and students in and out of class sessions to construct active and inclusive learning environments where all students' voices are heard and valued and where students talk about their learning  as our la yiheng is here to support your learning i en- courage you to connect with yiheng about general strategies for effective learning of cs material  your textbook   required

rithms rd edition by anany levitin   grading your grades for the course will be computed roughly based on   problem sets    project assignments  expected    small assignments and class participation   the above percentages may be changed if administrative concerns demand it     desired course outcomes   students understand and can calculate the time and space efficiency of algorithms including  big-o big-omega and theta notations    students understand and can employ conventional approaches to demonstrate algorithm cor-  rectness    students understand and can analyze classic sorting searching and graph algorithms and  their advantages and disadvantages in various contexts    students understand and can design and analyze algorithms in various categories including  iterative divide and conquer dynamic programming and greedy    students understand the concept of np-completeness and its significance in studying the  time efficiency of algorithms    students can work in teams to understand describe and analyze algorithms   lectures classroom discussions and classroom accountability  all students are responsible for all information given in class whether or not it is presented in any other form handout course website textbook etc   thus although lecture attendance is not mandatory it is strongly encouraged and it is essential that students who miss lecture consult classmates and find out about any information academic administrative or other that they missed  there may be severe unintended consequences for students who do not keep up with all information from class  it is your responsibility to see that this does not happen to you  the easiest way to ensure it attend every lecture   before each class students are expected to review material from the previous class meeting the new material will build upon previously covered material so review is important for understanding new material as it is presented  it is also expected that before each class you will read though not necessarily completely understand the section of material to be covered in the next class  please use class lecture notes and the course textbook as complementary sources of information in cases of discrepancy please notify your professor immediately   there will be many opportunities for discussion and participation during class meetings re- viewing old material and reading new material can give these discussions more value for everyone in the class  an important part of the value of these discussions is explanation it is absolutely not expected that every response in a class discussion will be correct it is important however that students try to give reasons for their answers  note that participation is part of the course grade which requires actively contributing to in-class discussion the lecture notes of the first day's class meeting contain additional details about ways to contribute to in-class discussion   use of computers  devices during class meetings scientific studies e g  sana et al   demonstrate that the use of phones computers tablets wearables or other electronic devices during class meetings negatively affects the learning environment in the classroom not just for the user of the device but for classmates around them as well  to improve our learning environment and as a courtesy to your classmates the use of such devices is strongly discouraged  if for any reason it is important that you use such a device during a class meeting please talk with me about how best to accommodate you     homework policies  this section presents course polices for problem sets and smaller assignments policies for  projects will be presented when they are assigned   problem sets and smaller assignments should all be typewritten and submitted electronically as pdfs detailed submission instructions will be provided  you are encouraged to use the latex document preparation system please see latex resources linked from our course homepage but that is not required  problem sets and smaller assignments are typically due at the beginning of class  pm on the due date assignments received after the beginning of class may be considered late  for purposes of having a consistent lateness policy that applies equally to everybody please do not consider deadlines as soft unless there are extenuating circumstances deadlines will be applied exactly as posted   as always indicate all sources of assistance and collaborators i e  anyone with whom you  discussed an assignment on every submitted assignment   both the larger problem sets and smaller assignments serve important purposes for the course  but because of their differences different policies apply to each   smaller assignments although these smaller assignments do not have as much weight in the final course grade as problem sets it is extremely important for learning and reinforcing of concepts in the course that each assignment be completed on time for example we may frequently go over the exercises in class the day they're due which substantially diminishes the value of late submitted work  these smaller assignments will be graded on a        scale they may frequently be graded on effort even more than correctness  the lateness policy is that if an assignment is handed in up to  week late the maximum grade it can receive is a  after that an automatic grade of  is given   when computing your final grade your lowest score from among the smaller assignments that were submitted on time or late and show substantial effort will be dropped see below for additional deadline information   problem sets problem sets are opportunities for deeper engagement with course material and because course material builds on what preceded it in the class it is important that problem sets be completed on time  problem sets submitted up to one week late will typically receive a  deduction every student will get one free lateness day for problem sets in the course however enabling a problem set to be submitted up to  hours late without penalty you do not need to ask for this extension it will just be granted   problem sets will receive a  deduction if they are submitted more than one week late or they are submitted after feedback on the assignment has been given to the class in any form email discussion during a class meeting returning graded work etc   i will try to give advance notice if we'll be going over a problem set within one week after it is submitted so students can avoid the extra lateness penalty   when computing your final grade your lowest score from among the problem sets that  were turned in on time or late and show substantial effort will be dropped   no homework problem set or smaller assignment will be accepted for credit   even as a lowest grade to be dropped after the last day of classes   as with all policies homework and grading policies are intended to be fair to everyone involved  they will be enforced fairly  extenuating circumstances will of course be considered  please feel free to ask me any questions about specific cases that may emerge over the semester    policy on collaboration and academic integrity  there may homework or project assignments on which collaboration is forbidden or restricted to a particular group working together such exercises will be explicitly noted by your professor  in general however collaboration will be permitted indeed you are encouraged to work with classmates on problem sets and smaller assignments  on homework exercises where collaboration is permitted you are encouraged to discuss ap- proaches to solving problems on a general level with your classmates as well as your professor of course  unless permission has been explicitly given by your professor however you may not discuss specifics with your classmates and the expression of your answer and your written work must be entirely your own  assignments done in teams are examples where permission has been granted as part of this in cases of collaboration if you know the answer and a classmate does not telling them the answer is a violation of class policy if a classmate needs further assistance they should see your professor or ta if applicable   in general assignments should be completed without consulting resources other than your text- book classmates tas and prof  using any resources electronic or print online or otherwise other than those explicitly permitted as course resources is prohibited receiving and copying solu- tions from any source a classmate a friend a published text an online source etc  is disallowed and using such material as inspiration and submitting highly derivative solutions is viewed as copying  in general on assignments furthermore on each submitted assignment you should al- ways cite and acknowledge i e  write down on the submitted assignment everyone with whom you discussed the assignment and all sources you consulted or from which you received assistance including your textbook classmates tas or other people   your professor reserves the right to ask students to verbally explain the reasoning behind any answer or code that they submit and to modify project grades based on the answers  it is vi- tally important that you turn in work that is your own reports of academic dishonesty are handled by an academic review board and a finding of academic dishonesty may result in sig- nificant sanctions  for more details on colby's academic integrity policies and procedures see httpswww colby eduacademicintegrity   in general the highest level of academic integrity is expected of every student in this class  if  there are any questions about collaboration or related policies please
