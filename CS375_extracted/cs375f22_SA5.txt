analysis of algorithms  cs  fall  smaller assignment   due by the beginning of class monday november    this smaller assignment will be graded on effort make a demonstrable strong effort to solve the problems and explain your answers thoroughly including if you were not able to solve an exercise what progress you made what was left unsolved and what made it hard to solve and submit your work on time and you will receive full credit   for this smaller assignment the standard file naming conventions apply please sub-  mit your typewritten answers in a pdf file named  cs sa userid pdf  where userid is replaced by your colby userid your full userid including class year and submit it to your submittedwork folder in your google drive space for this course    a general note for cs as always please present answers cleanly and explain them clearly and thoroughly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understand typed-up rather than handwritten answers are especially appreciated  graders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions  clear commu- nication is the point on every assignment   in general in cs unless explicitly specified otherwise answers without explanations may not receive full credit  please feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come up  exercises    clrs exercise  - pg    this exercise is intended to give you practice with the algorithm in section    as part of your answer please show the table constructed see figure   for this example for this exercise no additional explanation of your work is needed a correctly completed table will suffice  to make life easier for your graders please use x          on the vertical axis left side of table and y           on the horizontal access top of table   also please note that there may be more than one lcs of x and y   for this assign- ment give the one that results from the algorithm and the table it generates
