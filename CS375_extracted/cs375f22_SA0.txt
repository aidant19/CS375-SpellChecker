Analysis of AlgorithmsCS  Fall Small Assignment DueBY THE BEGINNING OF CLASS Wednesday September For this Smaller Assignment the standard file naming conventions apply Please submit your typewritten answers in a PDF file namedCS SAuseridpdfwhere userid is replaced by your Colby useridfor example my file would be calledCS SAeaaronpdf Additional submission instructions will be emailed to you soon including where tosubmit your PDF fileAs usual in CS if an exercise is given by number eg Exercise  pg that refers to our CLRS textbook unless stated otherwiseFrom your textbook CLRS please readAppendices A and BChapter  and A general note for CS As always please present answers cleanly and explainthem thoroughly giving all details needed to make your answers easy to understandGraders may not award full credit to incomplete or illegible solutions or answerswithout explanations Clear communication isthe point on every assignmentPlease feel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come upExercisesSet exercises Familiarity with sets and set operations is important for ComputerScience in generaland for algorithm design and complexity analysis in particularsohere are some warmup exercises Give a short explanation for every answerless thanone sentence could suffice as long as it demonstrates understanding of the relevant definitions  reasons for the answerFor the exercises below let Ax y zandBx ya True or False ABb True or False BAc True or False BBd What is AB Explicitly show the elements of ABe What is AB Explicitly show the elements of ABf What is AB Explicitly show the elements of ABg What is PB the power set of B Explicitly show the elements of PB Exercise  pg  We need only consider natural number values of n and wecan make the usual assumption that all input sizes are greater than  As happens sometimes in theoretical CS exercises this one begins with a completelygratuitous andtotally madeup backstory The Scientific Advancement Department atthe Portland Institute of Technology which to be clear does not actually exist hasasked for your help The entire department will soon be travelingtheyll be going tomajor European cities with welldeveloped subway systems such as London Englandor Paris Franceand theyve asked you to come up with an algorithm to find the bestroute for a subway passenger to take from one subway station to anothera The statement of this computational problem isnt fully unambiguously specifiedwhich happens frequently with realworld computational problems Ive experienced it myself several times in my research But you can help What are somereasonable criteria that could be used for defining the best route Give examplesb How would you use a graph as part of modeling and solving this problem Feelfree to look over Appendix B for a review of graph concepts if youd like
