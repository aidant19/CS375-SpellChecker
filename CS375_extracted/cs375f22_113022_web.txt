CS   CS   Analysis of Algorithms Professor Eric Aaron Lecture  M W pm Lecture Meeting Location Davis  Business  SA due pm Dec   SA involves working through an example of the alg o we covered last Monday  PS due already  PS out due Dec   PS will be the final PS for the semester  PS SA SA grading update  If you have any questions or comments please see me about feedback on your graded PSs  Project  due pm Monday Dec   Tell me your team by end of day today  Intended team size  but talk to me if youd pre fer to work with a smaller team size CS   The Trees  A tree sometimes called a free tree  is an acyclic connected undirected graph  Weve seen rooted trees such as binary trees before but from a more general graphoriented perspective trees do not ne ed to have roots  Important properties of free treesthe below stat ements are all equivalent for undirected graph G  V E  G is a free tree  Any two vertices in G are connected by a unique si mple path  G is connected but if any edge is removed the re sulting graph is disconnected  G is connected and E  V G is acyclic and E  V G is acyclic but if any edge is added to G the r esulting graph has a cycle A collection of possibly disconnected trees is called a forest  Really See CLRS Sec B and B See also the Rush album Hemispheres  which many people may find even more dense and inaccessible than the CLRS textbook Minimum Spanning Trees MSTs  Given a connected undirected graph G  VE an acyclic subgraph that connects all the vertices in V is a spanning tree of G  Its a tree and it covers spans all the verti ces of G  For network G represents unique connections  pat hs between each pair of nodes in G  Consider the minimum spanning tree MST problem given weighted undirected connected graph G find a spanning tree  T with minimal total weight over all edges in T CS   A Generic MST Algorithm Minimum spanning trees can be grown one edge at a time  Some vocabulary  A cut SVS of an undirected graph GVE is a partiti on of V  An edge uv crosses a cut if u is in S and v is in VS A cut respects a set of edges if no edge in the set crosses the cu t  A light edge is a minimumweight edge satisfying a property eg  a light edge that crosses a cut In the not too distant future  MST K How can this vocab be used to describe an MST algorithm Safe here means an edge that can be added without violating the property that A is a subgraph of an MST Digression How do we argue correctness of the algorithm Greedy MST Algorithms  Greedy strategy for building MSTs Add the best edge from edge set E of graph G repeat until an MST is built  Overall structure Turn a forest some trees have only  node into a tree by adding light edges connecting separate comp onents  Question What is the best edge the greedy choice to add  A possibility Pick the leastweight edge from E t hat connects two separate components  Possibly results in multiple trees growing       in the forest but all will be connected by the end  of the algorithm  Ie maintains a disjoint set of subtrees Invariant All subgraphs are trees How do we know CS   Data Structures Flashback Disjoint Sets  UnionFind  A unionfind data structure is used to maintain a collection of disjoint sets  Operations on disjoint sets Find  Given v find component set containing vUnion  Given components A B  replace them by their union A UB Representation a disjointset forest of rooted trees  Union operation joins trees Aand Binto a new rooted tree  Find operation gives the root of the tree containi ng v Use this representation with unionbyrank and pathcompression heuristics as data structure for MST algorithm See CLRS Chapter  for details of implementation and runtime complexity Kruskals Algorithm MST possibility Pick the leastweight edge from E that connects two separate components  Disjointset data structure maintains forest of MS T subtrees  Efficient to determine whether two vertices are al ready connected  Start by sorting edges leastweight first and ta ke edges in that order as long as they connect separate components  ie add light edges that connect subtrees CS   Kruskals Algorithm kontinued  Whats a correctness argument for Kruskals algorithm  Whats a complexity argument for it Kruskals Algorithm kontinued  Whats a complexity argument for Kruskals algorithm  Depends on the complexity of FindSet and Union f rom previous slide OV  E alphaE  And OE lg E to sort E so OE lg E thus OE lg V total CS   Example Exercise Greedy Algorithms  MSTs  Apply Kruskals algorithm to this graph to find a minimum spanning tree  Break ties where applicable by alphabetical ord ering on the endpoints of edges
