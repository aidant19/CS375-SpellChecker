Welcome To CS  Analysis of AlgorithmsColby College Fall Course CS   Analysis of AlgorithmsLecture M  W  PM meetings in Davis Website httpscscolbyeducoursesFcsCourse Description Analysis of Algorithms focuses on classic algorithms in computer science their design andthe analysis of their correctness and efficiency Algorithms covered include sorting searchingand other problem solving with various data structures including strings arrays lists trees andgraphs Major categories of algorithm design are discussed including the iterative divideandconquer exhaustive search dynamic programming and greedy paradigms Intractable problemsare also discussed as is the role of NPcompletenessPrerequisites CS and a level Math or Statistics courseYour Professor  Eric AaronWebsite

Center for Teaching and Learnings Teaching and Learning Colby TALC  Fellowship As part of this program our class includes a Learning Assistant atrained student partner who works with faculty and students in and out of class sessions to constructactive and inclusive learning environments where all students voices are heard and valued andwhere students talk about their learning As our LA Yiheng is here to support your learningI encourage you to connect with Yiheng about general strategies for effective learning of CS materialYour textbookREQUIRED Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition by Thomas H Cormen CharlesE Leiserson Ronald L Rivest and Clifford Steinrecommended NOT REQUIRED Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms rd Edition by Anany LevitinGrading  Your grades for the course will be computed roughly based onProblem sets Project Assignments  expected Small assignments and class participation The above percentages may be changed if administrative concerns demand itDesired Course OutcomesStudents understand and can calculate the time and space efficiency of algorithms includingbigO bigOmega and Theta notationsStudents understand and can employ conventional approaches to demonstrate algorithm correctnessStudents understand and can analyze classic sorting searching and graph algorithms andtheir advantages and disadvantages in various contextsStudents understand and can design and analyze algorithms in various categories includingiterative divide and conquer dynamic programming and greedyStudents understand the concept of NPCompleteness and its significance in studying thetime efficiency of algorithmsStudents can work in teams to understand describe and analyze algorithmsLectures Classroom Discussions and Classroom AccountabilityAll students are responsible for ALL information given in class whether or not it is presentedin any other form handout course website textbook etc Thus although lecture attendance isnot mandatory it is strongly encouraged and it is essential that students who miss lecture consultclassmates and find out about any informationacademic administrative or otherthat theymissed There may be severe unintended consequences for students who do not keep up with allinformation from class It is your responsibility to see that this does not happen to you The easiestway to ensure it Attend every lectureBefore each class students are expected to review material from the previous class meetingthenew material will build upon previously covered material so review is important for understandingnew material as it is presented It is also expected that before each class you will read though notnecessarily completely understand the section of material to be covered in the next class Pleaseuse class lecture notes and the course textbook as complementary sources of information in casesof discrepancy please notify your professor immediatelyThere will be many opportunities for discussion and participation during class meetings reviewing old material and reading new material can give these discussions more value for everyonein the class An important part of the value of these discussions is explanation  It is absolutely notexpected that every response in a class discussion will be correct it is important however thatstudents try to give reasons for their answers Note that participation is part of the course gradewhich requires actively contributing to inclass discussion the lecture notes of the first days classmeeting contain additional details about ways to contribute to inclass discussionUse of Computers  Devices during Class Meetings Scientific studies eg Sana et al demonstrate that the use of phones computers tablets wearables or other electronic devicesduring class meetings negatively affects the learning environment in the classroomnot just for theuser of the device but for classmates around them as well To improve our learning environmentand as a courtesy to your classmates the use of such devices is strongly discouraged If for anyreason it is important that you use such a device during a class meeting please talk with me abouthow best to accommodate youHomework PoliciesThis section presents course polices for problem sets and smaller assignments  policies forprojects will be presented when they are assignedProblem sets and smaller assignments should all be typewritten and submitted electronicallyas PDFs detailed submission instructions will be provided You are encouraged to use the L ATEXdocument preparation system please see L ATEX resources linked from our course homepage butthat is not required Problem sets and smaller assignments are typically due at the beginning ofclass  PM on the due date assignments received after the beginning of class may be consideredlate For purposes of having a consistent lateness policy that applies equally to everybody pleasedo not consider deadlines as softunless there are extenuating circumstances deadlines will beapplied exactly as postedAs always indicate all sources of assistance and collaborators ie anyone with whom youdiscussed an assignment on every submitted assignmentBoth the larger problem sets and smaller assignments serve important purposes for the coursebut because of their differences different policies apply to eachSmaller assignments Although these smaller assignments do not have as much weight in thefinal course grade as problem sets it is extremely important for learning and reinforcing of conceptsin the course that each assignment be completed on timefor example we may frequently go overthe exercises in class the day theyre due which substantially diminishes the value of late submittedwork These smaller assignments will be graded on a    scale they may frequentlybe graded on effort even more than correctness The lateness policy is that if an assignment ishanded in up to  week late the maximum grade it can receive is a  after that an automaticgrade of  is givenWhen computing your final grade your lowest score from among the smaller assignmentsthat were submitted on time or late and show substantial effort will be dropped seebelow for additional deadline informationProblem sets Problem sets are opportunities for deeper engagement with course material andbecause course material builds on what preceded it in the class it is important that problem setsbe completed on time Problem sets submitted up to one week late will typically receive a deduction every student will get one free lateness day for problem sets in the course howeverenabling a problem set to be submitted up to  hours late without penaltyyou do not need toask for this extension it will just be grantedProblem sets will receive a  deduction if they are submitted more than one week late orthey are submitted after feedback on the assignment has been given to the class in any form emaildiscussion during a class meeting returning graded work etc I will try to give advance notice ifwell be going over a problem set within one week after it is submitted so students can avoid theextra lateness penaltyWhen computing your final grade your lowest score from among the problem sets thatwere turned in on time or late and show substantial effort will be droppedNo homework Problem Set or Smaller Assignment will be accepted for crediteven as a lowest grade to be droppedafter the last day of classesAs with all policies homework and grading policies are intended to be fair to everyone involvedThey will be enforced fairly Extenuating circumstances will of course be considered Please feelfree to ask me any questions about specific cases that may emerge over the semesterPolicy on Collaboration and Academic IntegrityThere may homework or project assignments on which collaboration is forbidden or restrictedto a particular group working together such exercises will be explicitly noted by your professorIn general however collaboration will be permittedindeed you are encouraged to work withclassmates on problem sets and smaller assignmentsOn homework exercises where collaboration is permitted you are encouraged to discuss approaches to solving problems on a general level with your classmates as well as your professorof course Unless permission has been explicitly given by your professor however you may notdiscuss specifics with your classmates and the expression of your answer and your written workmust be entirely your own Assignments done in teams are examples where permission has beengranted As part of this in cases of collaboration if you know the answer and a classmate doesnot telling them the answer is a violation of class policy if a classmate needs further assistancethey should see your professor or TA if applicableIn general assignments should be completed without consulting resources other than your textbook classmates TAs and Prof Using any resources electronic or print online or otherwiseother than those explicitly permitted as course resources is prohibited receiving and copying solutions from any source a classmate a friend a published text an online source etc is disallowedand using such material as inspiration and submitting highly derivative solutions is viewed ascopying In general on assignments Furthermore on each submitted assignment you should always cite and acknowledge ie write down on the submitted assignment everyone with whomyou discussed the assignment and all sources you consulted or from which you received assistanceincluding your textbook classmates TAs or other peopleYour professor reserves the right to ask students to verbally explain the reasoning behind anyanswer or code that they submit and to modify project grades based on the answers It is vitally important that you turn in work that is your own Reports of academic dishonesty arehandled by an academic review board and a finding of academic dishonesty may result in significant sanctions For more details on Colbys Academic Integrity policies and procedures seehttpswwwcolbyeduacademicintegrityIn general the highest level of academic integrity is expected of every student in this class Ifthere are any
