Analysis of AlgorithmsCS  Fall Project DueBY pm on Wednesday September Project  Determining Algorithmic Time ComplexityIn this assignment youll work in teams of  or  to determine the asymptotic time complexities of methods in two Java Classes In Part  you will be given source code for the classand you will figure out asymptotic complexities by analyzing that code In Part  you willnotbe given the source code for the Classyou will instead conjecture about time complexity by using definitions of asymptotic complexity and analyzing the number of comparisonsthe methods make during executionThe goals of this project areto give you practice determining the worstcase time complexity of an algorithm givenits source codeto give you practice using the scientific method and the formal definitions of asymptoticcomplexity to guess at the worstcase time complexity of algorithms for which you donthave the source code andto give you practice working with other students in a teamExercises For Part   download the source code for the ArrayIntegerSet class from the courseProjects and Presentations websiteFor each constructor and method in the ArrayIntegerSet class determine its worstcase time complexity using  notation in terms of the number of elements nin theset and if appropriate any other data such as the size mof any parameters For eachmethod please add something like the following in its comment header Time complexity n where nis the size of this ArrayIntegerSetFor every method be sure to unambiguously state what each variable in your timecomplexity expression refers to For example if two relevant variables refer to arraysbe very clear which variable refers to which array For example please be more specificthan saying the input array as from some perspective any relevant parameter couldbe viewed as inputAlong with each asymptotic complexity bound include a short  sentences at mostexplanation of how you came up with your complexity bound If your answer dependsupon the complexity of other methods in the Class note that as wellBe sure to give the complexity of all methods except for main  whether public orprivate For Part   download the sortDatacsv file from the course Projects and Presentationswebsite This file contains the data obtained by running  sorting algorithms andcounting how many comparisons they make during execution The sorting algorithmsthemselves will not be made available to you The data in the file was gathered asfollows For each desired array size a random array Aof that size was created theneach of the sorting algorithms was run on array A To be clear All algorithms wererun on the same array ABased on this data make a useful conjecture on the worstcase asymptotic time complexity of each of the  algorithms to show a practical understanding of each algorithms performance Then write a report containing these conjectures and explanations supporting them For each be sure to explicitly employ the relevant formaldefinitions of asymptotic complexity used in your conjectures and include themathematical details about how you apply them to the data For example if usingbigO notation give the particular values of threshold input size nand leading constant cused to support your conjecture and show how they are applied to the datato lead to your conclusion if using  notation give the nvalue and both leadingconstants candc and similarly show how they are applied Full credit may not begiven for conjectures that are not consistent with the known asymptotic time complexity performance of these sorting algorithms so please be careful and detailed in youranalysisPlease be sure that your explanations discuss your reasons for supporting your conjectures or being skeptical of them if thats relevant because the formal definitions ofasymptotic complexity are essential for analyzing your conjectures please include alldetails necessary to show command of the relevant asymptotic complexity definitionsand how they are employed For example simply employing a statistical curvefittingmethod would not be sufficient for these exercises additional interrogation of the datadirectly relating to definitions of asymptotic complexity is requiredPlease keep the following notes in mindPlease treat this part of the project like a physics or chemistry project in which youare creating a report making conjectures based on the results of an experimentTherefore a significant part of evaluating your work will be the consideration ofwhether or not the data are sufficiently analyzed or if the conclusions are logicalIn other words dont just say Heres our conjecture     please also includeyour analysis of the data such as describing how you came up with your conjectureinstead of a different conjectureAs usual in CS assignments clear communication isthe point There will bedeductions if it is difficult for your grader to understand your process and conclusion Please treat your written report as being as important as your conclusionsAlso as usual for CS assignments please feel free to talk with me if you havequestions especially if you are unsure what to include in your reportWhat to SubmitEach group should submit just one set of answers In particular each team should submittwo filesFor Part  turn in a text file that includes only the source code that you analyzedand the time complexity information about all the methods as described in Exercise above The time complexity information should be included in the comment headerfor each functionTo indicate the team submitting that file please be sure to name your fileteamINITIALSArrayIntegerSetjavawhere INITIALS is replaced by the initials of the team members in the group in theteam assignments Eg if Eric Aaron and Stephanie Taylor were the teammates thefile from that team would be called team EASTArrayIntegerSetjava For Part  turn in a project report PDF file that has your report but in thefilename as above please add the prefix indicating your team members initials egteam EASTproject reportpdfLateness policy To keep pace with the project assignments in CS it is important thatthis assignment be turned in promptly For this project there will be a deduction of for each day lateie  deduction for submitting up to  hours late  deductionfor submitting more than  hours late up to  hours etcup to a  deduction forsubmitting up to  days  hours late After  days late submissions will receive aonethird   deduction Please submit your work promptlyAs always extenuating circumstances will be consideredplease contact me as soon aspossible if any extenuating circumstances are impeding your work on this projectSubmission instructions  For this project each group should have one designated submitter to handle submission of their materials The designated submitter should email meeaaroncolbyedu the two files
