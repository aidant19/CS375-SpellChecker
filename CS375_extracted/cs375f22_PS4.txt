Analysis of AlgorithmsCS  Fall Problem Set DueAT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS Wednesday November For this assignment standard file naming conventions apply Please submit your typewritten answers in a PDF file named CS PSuseridpdf where userid is replaced by your full Colby userid and submit it to your SubmittedWork folder Pleasereach out to me right away with any questions or concerns about thisA general note for CS When writing up your homework please present youranswers neatly and explain your answers clearly  giving all details needed to makeyour answers easy to understand Graders may not award full credit to incomplete orhard to understand solutions Clear communication isthe point on every assignmentIn general in CS unless explicitly specified otherwise answers should be accompanied by explanations Answers without explanations may not receive full credit Pleasefeel free to ask me any questions about explanations that might come upExercises Prof Nigma at the Portland Institute of Technology which still doesnt exist wasthrilled with your previous work and hired you again to analyze the algorithm givenhere in pseudocode As usual however Prof Nigma neglected to explain what thealgorithm doesdefQAn Input Array An ofnreal numbers for nifn return Aelse temp QAniftempAnreturn tempelse return Ana What does this algorithm compute Give an English description of what valueit returns on a given input array along with a convincing explanation of youranswer You do not need to give examples as part of your answer but as alwaysyou are welcome to include examples along with the English description if itwould make your answer clearerb What is the  complexity class of this algorithm To find it first state a recurrence for the time complexity of the algorithm then solve it using one of themethods presented in class for solving recurrences Be sure to give a thorough explanation of what makes your recurrence correct and show your work for solvingthe recurrence including showing a kth step in your method if you use unwinding or recursion trees If you use recursion trees give a table as on SmallerAssignment SA to show your work Consider a rectangle whose side lengths are two consecutive Fibonacci numbers Ofcourse neither of them is  Such a rectangle could be for example  by  or  by or  by  etca Give a recursive algorithm to dissect such a rectangle into squares such that nomore than two of the resulting squares are the same size For example if youhad two  by  squares you could have at most one  by  square Heres aspecification for your algorithm Input Two consecutive Fibonacci numbers f frepresenting an f by f rectangle such that f  fNeither f nor f will be  Output A list of integers representing side lengths of squaressuch that the input rectangle can be dissected into squaresof those sizes No more than two of the squares can be thesame sizePlease be sure to give an English description of the algorithm along with pseudocode explaining the main points of its design and a concise inductive argumentfor its correctness ie say what makes the base case correct what makes the recursive cases correct and how you know the algorithm terminatesb What is the time complexity of your algorithm in part a Give a recurrencefor your algorithm and solve it to get a  complexity bound As always fullyexplain your answer show your work in solving the recurrence and be sure toexplicitly say what each variable in your complexity class stands for eg if yourepresenting a  n algorithm be sure to say what nrefers to
